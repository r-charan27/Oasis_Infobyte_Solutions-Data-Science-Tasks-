ðŸ“Œ Task 4: Email Spam Detection ðŸ“¬ðŸš«
Objective:
Detect and classify email messages as spam or not spam using machine learning.

Overview:

Use a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails.
Apply NLP preprocessing: tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF vectorization.
Train classification models such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression.
Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Goal:
Build a machine learning-powered email spam filter that mimics real-world applications like Gmailâ€™s spam detection.
