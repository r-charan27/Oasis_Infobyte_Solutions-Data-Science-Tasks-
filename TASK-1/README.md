ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸
Objective:
Classify iris flowers into one of three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica â€” based on their measurements (petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width).

Overview:

Uses the famous Iris dataset (either from Scikit-learn or downloadable from UCI).
Applies classification models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, or SVM.
Visualizes the relationship between flower features using plots.
Goal:
Build a model that learns from labeled flower data and accurately classifies new samples.
