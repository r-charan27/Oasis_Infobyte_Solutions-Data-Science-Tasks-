## ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

**Objective:**  
Classify iris flowers into one of three species â€” *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica* â€” based on their measurements (petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width).

**Overview:**
- Uses the famous Iris dataset (either from Scikit-learn or downloadable from UCI).
- Applies classification models such as **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, or **SVM**.
- Visualizes the relationship between flower features using plots.

**Goal:**  
Build a model that learns from labeled flower data and accurately classifies new samples.

## ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Unemployment Rate Analysis ðŸ“‰

**Objective:**  
Analyze unemployment rates in India â€” especially the spike observed during COVID-19 â€” using data science techniques.

**Overview:**
- Load and clean time-series data on regional unemployment.
- Use visualizations to show unemployment trends by area and region.
- Perform feature engineering and train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict future unemployment rates.

**Goal:**  
Gain insights into the labor market during the pandemic and build a predictive unemployment model.

## ðŸ“Œ Task 3: Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’¸

**Objective:**  
Predict the price of a car based on its features like brand, horsepower, mileage, and other specifications.

**Overview:**
- Analyze and clean a dataset of used/new cars.
- Apply encoding to categorical features and normalize numeric values.
- Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict car prices.

**Goal:**  
Create a model that helps estimate the value of a car in the market, which is useful for buyers and sellers alike.

## ðŸ“Œ Task 4: Email Spam Detection ðŸ“¬ðŸš«

**Objective:**  
Detect and classify email messages as **spam** or **not spam** using machine learning.

**Overview:**
- Use a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails.
- Apply NLP preprocessing: tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF vectorization.
- Train classification models such as **Naive Bayes** or **Logistic Regression**.
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Goal:**  
Build a machine learning-powered email spam filter that mimics real-world applications like Gmailâ€™s spam detection.

## ðŸ“Œ Task 5: Sales Prediction ðŸ“¦ðŸ“Š

**Objective:**  
Predict how many products a business will sell based on advertising spend and customer segments.

**Overview:**
- Use a dataset containing ad budgets and sales performance.
- Explore relationships through scatter plots and heatmaps.
- Build a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict future sales.
- Evaluate using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics.

**Goal:**  
Help businesses understand the ROI of their marketing campaigns and plan future strategies.
